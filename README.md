# Azure Directory Security

Implementation for Active Directory integrations with Entra ID.

Copy the template for the `.auto.tfvars`:

```sh
cp config/template.tfvars .auto.tfvars
```

Set you public IP to be allowed in the firewalls:

```sh
dig +short myip.opendns.com @resolver1.opendns.com
```

Create the infrastructure:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

Terraform will install `AD-Domain-Services` via custom scripts extension.

Install the AD Domain Services package:

> If possible , set the domain to be the same as the Entra tenant. Needs to be <= 15 characters due to Active Directory dependency on NetBIOS.

```sh
# You'll need to type in the password and select "A" for all
Install-ADDSForest -DomainName contoso.local -InstallDNS
```

ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ The server will be restarted.

- Password Hash Synchronization
- Pass-through Authentication
- Federated Authentication
-

There are two offerings for sync:

- Entra Connect V2
- Entra Connect Cloud Sync

We'll proceed with [Connect V2][3] here.

Terraform will also have created an `administrator` account with `Hybrid Identity Administrator` privileged to be used during AD sync setup. Use it to configure synchronization.
